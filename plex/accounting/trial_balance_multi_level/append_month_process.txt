Run AccountingPeriod ETL script to update the Plex.accounting_period table with the most current periods. 

Run accounting_balance_last_full_period ETL script to determine the last full period with a balance snapshot.
 
Set the period range to be calculated.
Start from 2021-02 since 2021-01 is the anchor period.
In case any of the period snap shots have changed always start from 2021-02
until 2022-02 then we will have a years worth of values so the anchor 
can be increased to 2021-02. And an ETL script can be written to update this 
period range to be 1 year back.

Set the period range to be calculated. 
Should be 1 years worth eventually.
update Plex.accounting_balance_update_period_range
set period_start=202102,period_end=202112
where pcn=123681 -- southfield


update Plex.accounting_balance_update_period_range
set period_start=202002,period_end=202112
where pcn=300758 -- albion

Run the AccountBalanceUpdate ETL Script.
1. Call the Plex.set_accounting_balance_update_period_range procedure.
1. create procedure Plex.accounting_balance_delete_period_range
1. Delete the periods that are to be recalculated.
delete from 
Plex.account_period_balance b
where pcn=123681
and period between period_start and period_end

Albion has no valid data yet.
delete Plex.account_period_balance where  pcn = 300758

Run AccountBalanceUpdate ETL script to delete/re-add account_balance snapshot records.
 Plex.accounting_balance b 

Run AccountBalanceByPeriod ETL Script to validate account_period_balance calculation.

Run ETL Script to refresh the accounting_balance snapshots.

Add a new period to the Plex.account_period_balance table.

Actually I would like to know if we will be able to run the SSIS projects that use ZappySys components, 
such as the ZS XML Source component from with Visual Studio, SQL Server, and Azure Data Factory after the license has expired.


So If we deploy the SSIS projects to Azure Data Factory we will not be able to run them after the license has expired?
One more question please. If we delete our existing Azure Data Factory for some reason. And then recreate a new 
Azure Data Factory to is it possible to transfer the license to the new data factory?
