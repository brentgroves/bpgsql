Next_operation:
I think we got this strange code from a Plex web service. It is based on the part_operation and not on the job_operation
because this is how the web service did it.

    and po.operation_no > 
    (  -- find the part operation number for the container
        select
        po2.operation_no 
        from part_v_part_operation as po2
        where c.part_key = po2.part_key 
        and c.part_operation_key = po2.part_operation_key 
        and po2.active = 1  -- there can be only active part_operation_key record for a part operation number
    )
    and po.active = 1  -- I don't think this is necessary?
    and (pot.[Standard] = 1 OR pot.test = 1)  -- What is the brackets for?  Could we have put this in the inner select abov
    and po.suboperation = 0

Notes:
The quantity_loaded is directly from the container_status, but the quantity_ready and quantity_wip is deduced by some found 
web service logic.
