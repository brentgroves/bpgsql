There is a 1 to many relation between release_no and release_key.
Why:
I looked at release_no 644.
select * from sales_v_release where release_no = '644'
There were 4 release_keys with status of open, forecast.
There were 5 release keys with status of closed.
The add_date spanned a long period of time.
