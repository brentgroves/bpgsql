Started this for casey but did not finish it because I 
fixed a bug in customer_release_albion having to do with ordering of the 
WIP and Ready parts
and spent alot of time on part_wip_ready_loaded changing from part_ops to 
job_ops to determine if the next op is wip or ready.
Have not thouroughly tested these changes.
